              " 'growing up is hard enough without being  punching bag for all  teenage boys in your school. this is aiden’s daily hell, finding no peace once he has been labeled  gay kid by his classmates and being bullied for being filipino as well as weight-shamed. <i>flamer</i>,  debut graphic novel by mike curato, is based on his own frustrating experiences in high school and while it is often a brutal story dealing with bullying and  mental health struggles resulting from it, this is also an uplifting reminder that ‘<i>even if all of m were to forsake you, you are enough.</i>’ as frustrating as  bullying is in  novel is  fact that <i>flamer</i> has once again been one of  most banned or challenged books of  year, being  4th most challenged in 2022 (see  <a

this story gives readers a valuable lesson about self acceptance and endurance that doesn’t sugarcoat reality while still offering a lot of hope and heart.<br><br><a

personally it isn’t my favorite art style, i really love  contrast of  black and white with  bright orange and reds of fire that permeate this story. fire, and  term ‘flamer’, takes on a multitude of meanings, from insults thrown at him, to  idea of damnation. the language in this book is quite rough and very accurately reflects  slurs and abuse of teenage boys from even when i was in high school a decade after this book is set, and conversations on not using language like that wasn’t really mainstream yet. teachers would ignore slurs against queer students,  word gay was tossed around blily to mean anything you didn’t like, it was certainly a rough time to be dealing with secret concerns about being bisexual let me tell you. what really struck me was  aspect of aiden’s internalized guilt as he struggles with acceptance and his catholicism having taught him that being gay was a sin:<br><blockquote> ‘<i>i know i\\'m not gay. gay boys like or boys. i hate boys. they are mean and scary, and y\\'re always destroying something or saying something dumb or both. we learned at school how bad homosexuality is. it\\'s a sin. gay people do bad things. and i\\'m not a bad person. i try to do good. all  time. so i couldn\\'t be gay.</i>’</blockquote><br>having been raised catholic, this hit home. i’ll never forget watching star wars episode ii in aters and having it very much dawn on me that i wasn’t fully straight every time obi-wan came on screen and also  absolute horror of this revelation due to what i’ve been told that meant. because i sure didn’t feel like a demon. and in that culture it is difficult to know who to even talk to, because it still is an issue that people see as a hard-line. i’ve seen friends lose best friends or ir own families from simply coming out. this is a great book for those who need that comfort.<br><br>which is why it is appalling this is being banned all over  us, and that is part of a much larger conversation  stories of queer folks and people of color being erased and strategically removing language that allows people to understand and express ir identities. it is a constant headline in  us right now, with challenges on  rise, with 2022 being a significant increase:<br><a href=\"\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/186842559@n02/52864943750/in/dateposted-public/\"\" title=\"\"13f52393-9239-4322-9cfc-faf77a716bf0\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow

public institutions and harnessing government to override people’s intellectual freedoms and librarianship. <i>flamer</i> is a frequent target of this due to lgbtq content, which is frustrating as, in a <a href=\"\"https://pen.org/mike-curato-flamer-interview/\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow noopener\"\">conversation with pen america</a>, mike curato says that  aim of this book is suicide prevention. he adds:<br><blockquote> ‘<i>this is a book about telling someone that regardless of how someone may disagree with who you are as a person, you still deserve to be here. there is a place for you, and no one has  right to take that away.</i>’</blockquote><br>for this purpose,  book includes information on suicide prevention and offers many resources and hotlines. curato says that a big issue with book challenges and bans of books such as his own is that it perpetuates  culture of shame that this book grapples against. <br><br>‘<i>se are experiences that most teenagers go through. some parents would prefer ir children read about uncomfortable topics in a book because it’s a very safe place to learn. they can digest it at ir own pace. they can put  book down if y want to. and n i think re are some

deals with a lot of hard topics, but many will see mselves in it and find comfort re. it is pretty fun, for all  heaviness and bullying, taking place mostly during a boy scouts summer camp and a long summer of self discovery, acceptance and more. a worthwhile read.<br><br><b>4.5/5</b><br><br><a href=\"\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/186842559@n02/52864943780/in/dateposted-public/\"\"

              " \"this one is a little hard to review because i'm not  intended audience. i'll be honest though, i was incredibly uncomfortable reading about young teen boys making homophobic jokes, masturbating toger in a dark tent ( mc was also very uncomfortable with this) and getting repeated discussions of a 14-year-old boys introduction to porn, masturbation, and sexy dreams. really not things i want to be thinking about. (also, it's set in 1995 but that plus  unaddressed rampant bullying makes me wonder if i ever want to send my sons to anything similar?)<br /><br />that said, i do think this offers a raw and personal look into what it's like to be figuring out your sexuality when you don't fit in with everyone around you, you were raised with conservative religious values, and also feeling ostracized due to racial identity. the main character is at a boy scouts camp  summer before high school, slowly recognizing he has a crush on his roommate, and dealing with pretty severe bullying that is never adequately dealt with by camp staff. it's a lot, especially as a graphic novel. but i also imagine re are readers who need this and may feel seen by it and i do think re is value offering own voices narratives that address issues like racism and homophobia. i'm not entirely sure how  1995 setting (because i don't think everything would be quite  same today) will read for actual teenagers, so i hope we get some own voices teen reviewers of this one. i received an advance copy for review from  publisher. all opinions are my own.<br /><br />content warnings include repeated homophobic jokes and slurs including many uses of fa**ot, racist jokes and slurs toward asian idenity, suicidal ideation, incurred fat-shaming, teen sexuality including masturbation, group masturbation, pornography, sexual dreams.\",\n",

a decade after this book is set, and conversations on not using language like that wasn’t really mainstream yet. teachers would ignore slurs against queer students,  word gay was tossed around blily to mean anything you didn’t like, it was certainly a rough time to be dealing with secret concerns about being bisexual let me tell you. what really struck me was  aspect of aiden’s internalized guilt as he struggles with acceptance and his catholicism having taught him that being gay was a sin:<br><blockquote> ‘<i>i know i\\'m not gay. gay boys like or boys. i hate boys. they are mean and scary, and y\\'re always destroying something or saying something dumb or both. we learned at school how bad homosexuality is. it\\'s a sin. gay people do bad things. and i\\'m not a bad person. i try to do

that i wasn’t fully straight every time obi-wan came on screen and also  absolute horror of this revelation due to what i’ve been told that meant. because i sure didn’t feel like a demon. and in that

(also, it's set in 1995 but that plus  unaddressed rampant bullying makes me wonder if i ever want to send my sons to anything similar?)<br /><br />that said, i do think this offers a raw and personal look into what it's like to be figuring out your sexuality when you don't fit in with everyone around you, you were raised with conservative religious values, and also feeling ostracized due to racial identity. the main character is at a boy scouts camp  summer before high school, slowly recognizing he has a crush on his roommate, and dealing with pretty severe bullying that is never adequately dealt with by camp staff. it's a lot, especially as a graphic novel. but i also imagine re are readers who need this and may feel seen by it and i do think re is value offering own voices narratives that address issues like racism and homophobia. i'm not entirely sure how  1995 setting (because i don't think everything would be quite  same today) will read for actual teenagers, so i hope we get some own voices teen reviewers of this one. i received an advance copy for review from  publisher. all opinions are my own.<br /><br />content warnings include repeated homophobic jokes and slurs including many uses of fa**ot, racist jokes and slurs toward asian idenity, suicidal ideation, incurred fat-shaming, teen sexuality including masturbation, group masturbation, pornography, sexual dreams.\",\n",

              " '<strong>a banned book in florida</strong><br /><br />i read flamer because it’s a banned book in florida. i wanted to know what  hype was about. aiden navarro is a teen boy, raised and involved in  catholic church, away at boy scout camp,  summer before high school. aiden is dealing with parents who fight a lot, bullies everywhere he turns (for being chubby, having a soft voice, not being manly enough, not being white enough), and strange new feelings he’s not sure how to navigate. if people knew he wasn’t normal, y wouldn’t love him. he shares a tent with a boy he can’t stop thinking about, while worrying about what would happen if people knew. <br /><br />so why is this book banned in florida school libraries? it’s called pornographic, teaching kids how to be lgbtq. and dangerous for it’s suicidal ideation. is that  truth?<br /><br />this book contains many scenes of exactly what it was like to be a teenager in  90s. <br />rampant fear of homosexuality and aids. <br />ready access to pornography. <br />straight teenage boys talking non stop about ir junk. <br />going through puberty and discovering masturbation. <br />thoughts of suicide (it was  era of grunge). <br /><br />i think this book tries to provide a relatable story to kids that se feelings are normal and that if you stay strong, you will find a tribe of people willing to accept you. i think it would have done a better job of it if  author had provided a glimpse, maybe through an epilogue, of high school life that didn’t suck, or an epilogue showing where aiden is an adult living his best life. it’s awful dark without showing that this time period as a teenager gets better as you age. <br /><br />i do think this is a book that raises thoughts and feelings and glimpses of suicidal ideation without doing a better job at telling  reader how to manage m. the issue with this book, for me, isn’t  closeted gay kid fearing his thoughts and emotions. it’s  suicidal thoughts with an image depicting how he’d do it. there is a page at  end with resources to suicide hotlines. does a kid read past  acknowledgment section? i can see why groups think this book is dangerous. words matter. and a lack of words matter. should it be banned? no. i firmly believe no book should be banned. parents should be involved in what ir kids are reading and talking with m about it.',\n",

              " 'wow... non so sicura di riuscire a fare una recensione coerente... sono passate ormai ore eppure... continuo a sentire il mio cuoricino da fangirl battere fortissimo. sono emozionatissima e felicissima di aver scoperto questa novel. non la conoscevo e non sapevo cosa aspettarmi, ho solo sentito parlare dei premi che ha vinto e... beh.... è stato un salto nel buio e... che salto!!! strepitoso!!! la prima cosa che ho notato sono i disegni. molto semplici ma perfettamente adatti al contesto. questa storia ci appare subito familiare, ci regala una magica sensazione di casa, ci ricorda un po\\' il nostro passato e quel momento in cui ci siamo ritrovati a fare i conti con la prospettiva di diventare grandi. aiden navarro è un ragazzo che si appresta a cambiare completamente la sua vita. presto dovrà andare alle superiori e passare da una scuola media religiosa e \"\"chiusa\"\" a una pubblica e... piena di caos! si ritrova in una sorta di limbo cercando in tutti i modi di godersi l\\'estate nel camposcuola che frequenta ormai da parecchi anni. il giovane è spaventato e solo in quel campo, insieme ai suoi compagni e in particolare al migliore amico elias, si sente a casa. si sente come se potesse staccare la spina dimenticandosi di tutti i problemi che deve affrontare ogni giorno. è un ragazzo che ha infatti qualche chilo di troppo, è per metà asiatico ed etichettato per questo motivo, ha un padre che lavora molto e che quelle poche volte che è a casa... si sfoga con la famiglia, litigando furiosamente con la madre e facendola piangere. la madre è infatti spesso depressa e cerca conforto tra le braccia del suo figlio maggiore. aiden sente il peso per la condizione della sua mamma e anche la responsabilità di dare il buon esempio ai suoi fratellini più piccoli. un giovane che nonostante l\\'età risulta maturo e desideroso semplicemente di poter aiutare la sua famiglia, di poter trovare il suo posto nel mondo. purtroppo questo... non è così semplice. quelle settimane di campeggio che dovrebbero aiutarlo a rilassarsi lo spingono in tutt\\'altra direzione. aiden si ritrova a fare i conti con i bulletti che se la prendono con lui non solo per il suo aspetto fisico, è per la sua etnia ma anche per la sua presunta omosessualità. una cosa che lo stesso aiden non comprende, non riesce ad accettare. il ragazzo proviene da una famiglia religiosa, ha frequentato una scuola cattolica ed è abituato a vedere gli omosessuali come dei mostri, come persone crudeli e non destinate alla felicità, come peccatori che in tempi antichi venivano bruciati vivi e questo... lo spaventa moltissimo. da un po\\' di tempo ha iniziato a fare dei sogni strani sul suo amico e compagno di tenda, ha iniziato a vedere elias come un compagno ideale e questo gli fa... molta paura. aiden teme che la sua omosessualità gli toglierà tutto. ha paura di essere odiato ed emarginato. cerca in tutti i modi di evitare di pensarci ma più passa il tempo e più si rende conto che è impossible scappare. suo malgrado è costretto a compiere un viaggio, un percorso di crescita che lo porta a cercare il suo posto nel mondo, arrivando ad accettare fino in fondo chi è in realtà. con uno stile semplice e immediato, con una voce genuina e ironica mike ci porta nella testa di un adolescente come tanti. un ragazzo che vive turbamenti tipici della sua età, che ha paura di subire violenza per quello che è, per qualcosa che non può controllare, per una colpa che non ha. molti di noi hanno avuto a che fare con i bulli e possono capire come questi.... anche solo a volte con le semplici parole riescano a distruggere psicologicamente una persona e questa cosa... si sente. aiden ci porta nel suo mondo, nella sua vita, ci fa toccare con mano le stesse insicurezze che abbiamo vissuto e superato crescendo. per tutto il tempo ti viene voglia di abbracciare questo piccolo guerriero, ti viene voglia di dirgli che anche se il mondo gli volterà le spalle tu ci sarai, gli darai quell\\'affetto e quel sorriso che si merita. mi sono commessa tantissimo. ci sono dei momenti semplicemente strazianti e così realistici da far male, da far disperare e piangere come delle fontane. ho adorato la caratterizzazione non solo del protagonista ma anche del suo mondo. i personaggi che aiden incontra sono così realistici da poter quasi essere toccati. le storie degli amici e conoscenti di aiden, anche se non mostrate nella loro interezza, sono messe a nudo per donarci una chiave di lettura completa di tutta l\\'opera portandoci a toccare con mano il peso che l\\'odio e la discriminazione possono avere ogni giorno sulle persone che ci stanno accanto. è semplicemente una lettura straordinaria dall\\'inizio alla fine. potrei rimanere ore e ore a parlare di quanto mi sia innamorata di questa fantastica opera. tutto è perfetto. la frase che è stata associata a questo progetto \"\"questo libro salverà delle vite\"\" è quanto di più vero ci potrebbe essere. sembra strano ma... credo davvero che questa piccola gemma possa aiutare qualcuno. la storia di aiden è una testimonianza di quanto sia spaventoso e doloroso crescere, di quanto ci possano essere difficoltà e paure dietro ogni angolo ma è anche la dimostrazione di come la vita possa nel bene e nel male essere fonte di gioia e amore. aiden nonostante non se ne accorga è circondato dall\\'affetto e dall\\'amore e solo quando riuscirà a rendersi conto di non essere sbagliato, di non essere solo, di avere persone disposte ad ascoltarlo e accettare la sua diversità, il suo essere unico e speciale, potrà finalmente abbracciare la sua vera essenza, il suo vero io, trovando il suo \"\"vero nord\"\". questo è un inno alla vita, un canto che ci spinge ad andare avanti sempre e comunque, a lottare e rischiare per esprimere la nostra identità senza per forza uniformarci alla massa, senza rinunciare a ciò che ci rende noi stessi. credo che dovrebbe essere letto nelle scuole perché sono convinta che molti ragazzi leggendolo... potrebbero riconoscersi in aiden e nelle sue paure e decidere di non arrendersi, di seguire il suo esempio e semplicemente vivere appieno la vita combattendo contro quei bulli ignoranti e intolleranti. una novel incantevole e priva di difetti e che deve essere letta da grandi e piccini. un messaggio straordinario che merita di essere condiviso con il mondo intero ❤️ <br />sicuramente recupererò presto il cartaceo italiano! deve assolutamente far parte della mia collezione ❤️<br /><br />-----<br /><br />capolavoro ❤️ devo riprendermi per poter mettere per iscritto i miei pensieri da fangirl 😍😭 intanto... si merita 5 stelline!!! leggetela! ne vale la pena!!!

(for lack of a better word) about this than or coming out stories. i think it\\'s  fact that it all takes place at a boy scout camp. he is literally only with or guys all  time and it felt like a pressure cooker of masculinity he could never escape, even though he did have a few friends. it\\'s so sad how even when alone (alone meaning, only with ir gender)  guys all felt such a need to perform and be  picture of masculinity  whole time. girls would just never act like this (girls have ir own issues, of course). it felt very true to life and  decision to set it re made  tension of  book build and build. <br /><br />i also loved  moments of when he looked up to  slightly \"\"different\"\" counselor and was in awe of how he saw his differences as cool. he tried to imitate his hairstyle and or things about him because he felt like those were somehow  things that made his difference okay instead of bad, like he felt his were. i definitely remember feeling like that when i was younger---watching  kids that were 3-4 years older than you and wondering how y got re, how y pulled off wearing ______, how i could be like m, etc. <br /><br />i also liked  religious aspect. unfortunately religion is not a safespace for most lgbtq people and  book did a great job showing how badly he wanted to fit in to that community/be \"\"holy\"\" but felt he never would.<br /><br />also, something i don\\'t think i\\'ve ever seen in any coming out books--- confusion he felt when he was essentially like, \"\"well, i can\\'t be <b>gay!</b>because i can\\'t stand any of se guys. they\\'re <i>mean</i>, we don\\'t have  same interests, y smell, y all hate me, etc...\"\" the only guys he knows are bullying him constantly and basically suck! so he is trying to reconcile that with  idea he might be gay even though men/boys are nothing but awful to him. just anor layer of coming to terms with your sexuality i\\'d never considered.<br /><br />great read; recommend for *any* young adult...or adult, for that matter.<br />',\n",

              " '(originally reviewed at <b>\\n  <a href=\"\"https://libraryladies.com\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow noopener\"\">libraryladies.com</a>\\n</b>)<br /><br />i never did  whole summer camp thing as a kid. as far as i got was  ymca day camp program, but i was such an anxious kid with separation anxiety issues like whoa, overnight sleep away camp was never going to work. i do feel like i missed something, especially since my sister did do one and really enjoyed it. so i do like reading stories that take place at summer camp. i stumbled upon “flamer” by mike curato on goodreads, and  mes sounded very much in my wheelhouse.<br /><br />in some ways, “flamer” feels a bit like  graphic memoir “honor girl” in that it has a teenager at camp struggling with ir sexuality in  mid 90s. but for me  difference is that aiden, our main character and fictionalized portrayal of curato, has a lot more self loathing and and a lot more fear about his sexuality. aiden is an outsider already, in that he’s bi-racial, he’s on  chubbier side, and he’s an easy target at his middle school, as well as for his emotionally abusive far. so while he has usually felt like he fits in at scout camp, his burgeoning sexuality starts to drive his anxiety up, especially as  micro aggressions and flat out bigotry of  time start to become more and more apparent. the story is mostly  last week at scout camp, as his safe space starts to feel less safe, and he moves towards an unknown future of high school and self discovery. curato doesn’t shy away from  ugliness that aiden has to deal with, be it because of his heritage, because of how he presents as more femme than his fellow scouts, and how se stresses and  bullying is taking a toll on him and driving him to dark places. aiden could be a mirror for many kids who are dealing with ir own identity discoveries, and how  world around m can make those discoveries hard. the cruelty isn’t limited to fellow scouts, but also pops up with leaders who seem supportive, but have ir own prejudices that y are harboring and that aren’t as hidden as y may think.<br /><br />there is also a prevalent me about aiden’s catholic faith, and how he has always been drawn to certain aspects of  religion and  rituals. i know very little about catholicism, but i thought that curato really evoked  appreciation that aiden has, from being an alter boy to having a favorite saint that he relates to, to  struggles he has with his sexuality because of what he believes his religion says about lgbtqia people. it’s a really fine line that curato walks in that he definitely condemns  bigotry of those who may practice  religion, but never points fingers at  religion itself, nor does he say that  religion is ‘bad’ in this situation. i think that it would be easy to eir condemn  religion as a whole, or to let it and all of its adherents off. but curato finds a balance in  middle, and it works very well, and makes some of  moments near  end of  story all  more heartbreaking and powerful.<br /><br />along with those aspects, curato also has a great author’s note in  back, as well as a list of resources for kids who may be dealign with  same things that aiden is dealing with. i love it when books do this, and it feels like a really great resource to have in this story in particular.<br /><br />and finally,  art work. loved it. it’s black and white, but re are splashes of color, specifically those of reds, oranges, and yellows. all of those work for passion, for fire, for anger, for love, and it makes  moments y are used pop and all  more powerful.<br /><br />“flamer” is a bittersweet and hopeful graphic novel that i hope people get in kids hands. you never know who is going to need a story like this.',\n",
              " \"an open letter to people attempting to ban this book: <br /><br />flamer by mike curato was recently featured in an article in our local newspaper as one being challenged by a group of people who wanted it removed from  library for being inappropriate. immediately i requested  book, being curious about what y were so up in arms about, here are my thoughts. (also, i'm adamantly against banning books, in any circumstance). <br /><br />1. if you could switch  two characters around for a male/female duo and  happenings of  book do not offend, guess what, re is nothing wrong with  story (but, you might want to examine your own feelings of homophobia). <br /><br />2. if you read this book and think that  off-color jokes are inappropriate for  audience (middle and high school boys), n let me tell you, you've eir not spent any time with  audience or y are always on ir best behavior when y are with you. this is how boys talk, even boys littler than this. this is how y talk about sexual things. this is how y joke. this is how cruel y are to each or.<br /><br />3. if you read this and felt uncomfortable with  jokes or this tiny insight into  life of 14 year old boys ... this book probably wasn't written for you. it's okay to let books exist that aren't for you - you can just not read m. furr, just like men are uncomfortable reading about  details of period care for middle school-aged girls, adult women probably have a hard time connecting with  crude humor of middle school-aged boys (adult women are  bulk of  challengers for this book - that's why i made this distinction). <br /><br />4. the moral of this story is that even if your life is hard. even if you spent weeks with people who constantly made fun of you for possibly being gay. even if you feel like you don't have any friends. you shouldn't end your life. that's  moral of  story. anyone who read all  pages would know that  goal of this book is to encourage kids who feel like y don't belong to stay alive. if you have a problem with that message being spread to  kids of any community, i question your judgment of ya resources. <br /><br />in  end, this story wasn't written for me. i'm a middle-aged, straight, cis white woman. however, having been a librarian, being someone who loves and cares for  kids in my community, knowing that i want all kids to feel like y are safe and that y belong and  world needs m alive ... i think this title is a great one for public library shelves. <br /><br />but, thanks for trying to ban it i guess, because i probably wouldn't have known about it. now i can recommend it to everyone. because you tried to ban  book, so many more people know about it and know that our little public library has resources for everyone on its shelves. \",\n",
              " 'this book was incredibly well done. the artistry is great and works well with  story. i like that it wasn\\'t just people talking, but also aiden sharing his thoughts and feelings. i know this was based off  author\\'s real life experiences, which makes it even more poignant. <br /><br />the story takes place in  mid-nineties, which i thought was interesting. i am a nineties girl (i went to high school and college back n) and love  pop culture from that era, so i was digging  music references. at aiden\\'s age, i didn\\'t have a problem with people being gay, but re was still a stigma surrounding homosexuality at  time. preteens and teens used it to bully ors, like accusing m of being gay or lesbian as a way to be cruel. (it happened in this book, regardless of wher or not aiden was gay.) around  time i graduated high school, i started going to <i>rocky horror</i>, which really helped when some friends came out to me during my college years. <br /><br />i felt bad for aiden when he was struggling with questioning his sexuality and also up against peer pressure, bullying, his religious beliefs, and his feelings for one of his friends at  camp. <br /><br />the story goes to a dark place sometimes and also has some mature content. you don\\'t see anything, but some language is used and re is slight nudity during  shower scene. so i\\'d probably put it at a pg-13 rating. (i was reading v.c. andrews books at 13, so i may have different parameters on appropriateness.) <br /><br />anyway, i really liked <a href=\"\"https://goodreads.com/book/show/52751434.flamer\"\" title=\"\"flamer by mike curato\"\" rel=\"\"noopener\"\">flamer</a> and i hope <a href=\"\"https://goodreads.com/author/show/7760185.mike_curato\"\" title=\"\"mike curato\"\" rel=\"\"noopener\"\">mike curato</a> writes a follow-up about aiden\\'s experiences in high school.

              " 'a few months ago, re were a couple of graphic novels that i heard about somewhere online and was lucky enough to receive for review. flamer by mike curato was one such ya graphic novel that i requested. now, having read it, i can say that flamer is a realistic portrait about what being closeted in  90s would’ve been like and a damning critique of how organizations for young adults and teens really failed  most marginalized within ir community at  time.<br /><br />it’s  summer between middle school and high school, and aiden navarro is away at boy scout camp. everyone in his troop are going through changes, but somehow, for aiden,  stakes feel even higher. as he navigates friendships, deals with bullies, and spends time with elias, a boy he can’t stop thinking about, he finds himself on a path of self-discovery and acceptance. mike curato is  award-winning author and illustrator of picture books, including  little elliot series and worm loves worm. in his debut graphic novel and first book for young adults, flamer, he draws on his own experiences and tells a difficult story with humour, compassion, and love. <br /><br />flamer takes place over  course of a week in 1995, a time when  boy scouts didn’t accept queer people or anyone who wasn’t a boy or man in  organization. while today’s teens might not have been aware that this had changed relatively recently, for those readers who do know  history of  boy scouts, this type of discrimination is a shadow hanging over everything that happens. in particular,  book demonstrates  bullying that aiden faces from many of  or campers regarding his perceived sexuality, his half filipino identity, his female bff, and his propensity to imagine himself in  roles of female character wher he is playing a game of dungeons &amp; dragons, reading his x-men comics, singing a campfire song, or when he’s simply dreaming or daydreaming. <br /><br />for aiden, camp life isn’t all negative. yes, most of  or boys at camp can sense that re is something different about him, and thus, aiden becomes  target of a lot of negativity, including moments when some of m mock his filipino features and use derogatory language for being gay. sometimes se behaviours were whispered right in front of  counsellors, who didn’t do anything about it, though it’s possible that y hadn’t heard. similarly, aiden doesn’t tell  authority figures that things are getting increasingly bad it’s getting for him, possibly he’s conditioned to knowing that tattling on ors will only make things worse for him. still, he wishes he could stay at camp rar than start high school in a couple of weeks because at least re he understands what’s expected of him. he has friends and a lot of  or boys come to him for advice on various topics. he also loves  outdoors and he’s good at finding firewood, cooking meals, and making things using his knot tying skills. all of se positives don’t totally destroy  negative aspects of camp, but i got a sense that  bullying he experiences at school is a lot worse. <br /><br />still,  fact that he’s being singled out as queer creates a lot of tension. first, while aiden may not understand why he’s suddenly dreaming about elias and finds him always on his own mind, he doesn’t think it’s because he’s gay. or at least that’s what he tells himself because 1) he doesn’t like boys because a lot of boys he knows from school are really mean to him, and 2) he’s internalized a lot of homophobic thinking from his religion and  world at large, including  boy scouts camp. aiden looked up to and tried to imitate one of  counsellors, and suddenly he’s fired and n rumours begin to spread throughout  camp that he was let go for being gay. for aiden, who lives in a homophobic society, it’s furr proof that who he might be is wrong and distressing. in this way, curato reminds  reader that even though  boy scouts have become more inclusive since  1995, ir history as an organization is fraught with homophobia, which hurt him as a teen and likely hurt a lot of or closeted boy scouts. the author knows that it’s important that people don’t forget  ways  boy scouts did a disservice to young boys and men even though y have changed ir ways now. <br /><br />when it comes to  art, much of flamer looks simple. most of  panels and pages are in monochromatic blacks, greys, and whites and are drawn in a way where  strokes are visible and deliberate. occasionally re are greys that appear to have been done with watercolour though. beyond  main colour palette, re are some pages and panels that integrate what looks like  sanguine colour of conté crayons and n, in key moments with heightened emotions,  art includes  yellows and reds associated with fire, in general, campfires, in particular, and  x-men character of jean grey and her alternate personality, phoenix. my favourite scene is when aiden and elias sneak out for a boat trip to see  — drawings are so well done that i couldn’t help but feel like i was re, underneath  , too. the artwork is absolutely beautiful and really compliments  emotions of  story. <br /><br />aiden is only 14, which would normally suggest that  book should be targeted toward middle grade or junior high audiences, not teen ones. however, i think because of  nature of some of  plot points in this graphic novel, it makes sense that henry holt marketed it toward  14+ age group. that doesn’t mean that someone younger than 14 can’t read and enjoy it, but i think it would be good for ir parents, teacher, or librarians to have an understanding of  child’s maturity level before y pick it up. anor option, of course, would be for an adult to read this book alongside ir child, so y can discuss some of  events toger. <br /><br />sound good? then i highly recommend that you check out this own voices filipino and queer graphic novel!<br />',\n",

              " 'every once in a while i read a book that has  ability to save lives, and this is one such book. i was persuaded to read it after hearing an outpouring of conservative outrage, which usually leads me to want to read  thing being lambasted as \"\"offensive\"\" and \"\"terrible.\"\" as i suspected,  \"\"vulgar\"\" moments can be boiled down to a couple of out of context pages involving crude teenage humor, a couple of which are actually meant to be portrayed as bullying (which is very obviously not something  author condones). <br /><br />the real issue, i suspect, is that this graphic novel focuses on a young boy as he realizes he might be developing feelings for his male friend, and follows him as he grapples with society\\'s expectations and his catholic upbringing. as with any book that dares to portray  reality of growing up lgbtq+, i think  outrage has far more to do with  character\\'s sexual orientation than how \"\"vulgar\"\" it is. <br /><br /><i>flamer</i>, as mentioned above, follows  story of a young teenaged boy named aiden navarro. it\\'s  summer between middle school and high school, and navarro is attending camp with what appears to be his boy scout troop (though  boy scouts are never mentioned by name). while re, navarro is forced to navigate his friendships, deal with bullies, and grapple with  new and strange feelings he\\'s developing for his friend elias. this story is very much a coming-of-age novel, as aiden navarro must learn to accept himself for who he is. <br /><br />one of  most striking things about this book is how it is entirely black and white except for two things:  flames and aiden\\'s pocket knife. not only does it look visually stunning on  page, but has a deeper meaning within  context of  story as well. the title, <i>flamer</i>, holds important meaning in this story, as \"\"flamer\"\" is often used as a derogatory term for gay men. there are also a great deal of flames involved in camping, from lighting matches to roasting s\\'more\\'s over a campfire. curato uses this as a bit of a visual pun throughout  novel, highlighting  flames to remind us of aiden\\'s literal and metaphorical journey throughout  book. <br /><br />this imagery becomes even more powerful when aiden feels as though he has no friends left, and wanders off by himself with his pocket knife. though he is clearly meaning to harm - or even kill - himself, aiden imagines himself as a phoenix like his favorite superhero, jean grey (also known as  dark phoenix). much like fire, phoenixes often symbolize rebirth, or transforming oneself to become something new. i loved how this was presented in <i>flamer,</i> as it symbolizes  moment in which aiden truly begins to accept himself for who he is. i think that\\'s a very powerful message, and one that a lot of queer kids and teens really need to hear. <br /><br />as for  vulgarity, i could potentially see how one could find certain scenes to be questionable out of context, but... se are <i>literally</i> teenage boys away at summer camp without parental supervision. i\\'m not sure if  conservative critics have ever <i>met</i> a teenage boy, but y tend to act exactly like  boys in this story. they can sometimes be crass, immature, and full of vulgar humor, and y often call one anor really nasty names. the story also mentions aiden discovering porn for  first time, which i feel is pretty normal for a teenage boy. considering this book was based on curato\\'s own life experiences, i don\\'t think  rest of us have a right to question his lived truth. after all, who can better capture what it\\'s like to be a teenage boy than someone who actually <i>was</i> a teenage boy?<br /><br />without getting too long-winded, i have to say that this book is incredibly powerful, and one that i truly believe will help pre-teens and teens who might be starting to question ir sexual identity. aiden comes across as being incredibly relatable, as he\\'s kind of an awkward kid with insecurities about his body and appearances. even as an adult woman, i could relate to aiden\\'s feelings of being an outcast at that age, as i think all of us feel as though we\\'re aliens from a different planet at certain points in our development. i couldn\\'t even imagine adding on  stress of realizing you\\'re lgbtq+, especially during a time (this book is set in  1990s) when you could lose your job for being gay. <br /><br />i applaud curato for sharing this story with  world, especially since it has garnered so much backlash. it\\'s a brave thing to be able to share your truth with  world, but he did it to offer a life line to today\\'s teens, some of whom might be struggling with similar issues. as always, i think it\\'s absolutely crucial for books like this to exist, if only to show kids that y aren\\'t alone in ir experiences and feelings. if you\\'ve heard negative things about this book, i would highly encourage you to read it anyways and come up to your own conclusions; i think you might just be surprised at how much it might teach you about acceptance and tolerance. i look forward to reading curato\\'s next work, and i hope he continues to be an outspoken voice for those who feel unseen and misunderstood.',\n",

(i barely got to do any of this stuff when i was a kid).<br /><br />and that ending. holy shit. what a stab through  heart. yet it also sings to your heart, and your tear ducts. what powerful imagery. what a powerful message, that really could save lives.<br /><br />\\'flamer\\' is semi-autobiographical, and it is very real, filled with reflections of real lives.<br /><br />and real hope.<br /><br />aiden, like all people who are alive no matter what y are going through, has a spark, a lifeforce, inside of him, that no one can extinguish. he is in charge of his life, and his destiny. he is him; screw anyone who will have a problem with that.<br /><br />he matters. he is enough.<br /><br />his fire of life - his soul - is represented as a superpower, and it is <i>fire</i>, and will defend itself. his soul is a superhero - <i>he</i> is a superhero, like jean grey. in an inspired and ingenious subversion of  classic comics, aiden\\'s phoenix, unlike jean grey\\'s, is not portrayed as a problem, as a bad thing needing to be extinguished for  good of mankind and  universe, killing him in  process. it\\'s just  opposite. aiden\\'s phoenix is powerful - <i>blazing</i> - for he is powerful, and strong, not dangerous or scary at all. it is who he is, and it is heroic.<br /><br />it is enough.<br /><br />there is nothing wrong with him. he is not broken.<br /><br />he is loved. no matter how painful his situation is, he is not alone.<br /><br />\\'flamer\\' is a marvellous and life affirming lbgtq comic. the sketchy, cartoony black and white art, with added red for  fire and or symbolic features and panels, is deceptively simple. true power lies underneath  surface level, after all.<br /><br />it loses a star mainly because, whilst reading, it was difficult for me to get into  \"\"boyish\"\" humour. it is set in an all-boys\\' summer camp. the type of humour on display here isn\\'t merely cringey; it is, objectively, absolutely disgusting. weiner jokes, penetration jokes, gay jokes (of course), misogynistic language (y are not jokes, y\\'re just misogynistic), fart jokes, \"\"your mom\"\" jokes, and \"\"taking care of business\"\" - meaning, a group of boys ejaculating into a bottle and  person who doesn\\'t cum has to drink it - <i>jeeeeeeeeeeeebuuuuuuuuussssssssssssssss!!!</i> were boys really like this in  nineties? are y still like this?! at  very least, i hope y don\\'t still casually call each or homophobic slurs as much as y would call each or \"\"pal\"\" and \"\"dude\"\". hurtful, hateful, vile slurs have no place in any society.<br /><br />toxic masculinity has some serious complexes and issues it needs to sort out! it literally makes no sense.<br /><br />\\'flamer\\' does highlight healthy ways in which young people can discover masturbation, however, and even when it is framed through  perspective of  sheltered and scared aiden,  comic makes it clear that it is normal, and not shameful or embarrassing or sinful.<br /><br />additionally, aiden\\'s situation at home involving his abusive far, and how he and his mor and younger siblings practically live in fear of him, isn\\'t really resolved, sadly. it is one thing that might never get better overtime,  longer aiden stays in it.<br /><br />but overall, \\'flamer\\' is brilliant.<br /><br /><br /><br />\\'<i>i know i\\'m not gay. gay boys like or boys. i hate boys. they\\'re mean, and scary, and y\\'re always destroying something or saying something dumb or both.</i>\\'<br /><br /><br />\\'<i>i hate bullies. i don\\'t understand what y get out of it.</i>\\'<br /><br /><br />\\'<i>i hate that word. gay. it makes me feel...unsafe.</i>\\'<br /><br /><br />\\'<i>i wish i were like jean grey</i> [...] <i>although, if i were wolverine, i could trim off my fat and instantly heal! screw dieting!</i>\\'<br /><br /><br />\\'[...] <i>this fire isn\\'t done burning.</i>\\'<br /><br /><br /><br />final score: 4/5',\n",

              " 'heard about this book from curato\\'s <a href=\"\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzvjefjvhtk\"\" rel=\"\"nofollow noopener\"\">talk @ google</a>.<br /><br />this is one of those auto-biographical buildungsroman that a writer always has to write --to narrate and reflect on ir own life. because it is such a courageously personal story, its greatest value is in its ability to connect to  people who needs  affirmation,  sense of connection and understanding. curato speaks of  void of representation and intersectionality in young adult literature for someone like him, and this is a wonderful attempt to fill that void. perhaps it is a deeply personal story, perhaps some can see it as a universal tale of being true to oneself, but it\\'s quite clearly genuine and unapologetic, which is a very brave thing to do as a writer.<br /><br />story-line wise, i did find some characterization to be overly trite and caricatured from an outsider perspective (not having an american childhood), but  plot movement is engaging and well-paced. in a very well-intentioned way, i think curato packs in many important issues for young adults (identity, mental health etc), which while relatable, feels a little heavy-handed. <br /><br />i\\'m personally not a big fan of  rawness of illustration, although i understand it\\'s an intential feature to reflect  intensity of emotions. the style of illustration is distinctive, and  use of red as a single color against a monochromatic palette is well-considered and thoughtful. my personal favorite spread, however, remains  monochromatic night sky.<br /><br />overall, i think this is a relevant and enjoyable read, and especially valuable and helpful for those who this book speaks to truly and dearly.',\n",
              " 'aiden navarro is fourteen and attending summer camp with his boy scout troop. he is leaving his catholic middle school and has decided to go to public high school, though he’s starting to dread what that means in terms of  bullying escalating even farr. after all, he doesn’t know how to dress himself since he’s been wearing a uniform to school for years. he also worries about how his sister is coping with his often abusive far now that aiden is gone to camp. to make it all more complicated, aiden is also gay and closeted. when he finds himself becoming attracted to one of his friends, aiden has to decide wher to let him know or not. when things don’t go well, aiden reaches a dark place that has him questioning how to go on.<br /><br />curato has created a graphic novel that really speaks to self discovery and learning how to survive. the setting of  summer camp really creates an atmosphere of freedom mixed with closely living with or boys his age. this can be a mix of exhilarating but also being unable to escape from bullying that targets aiden’s sexuality. i applaud curato for incorporating exactly  sorts of dirty jokes that boys in a group make toger, all of m teasing about sexuality in a way that is damaging and hurtful.<br /><br />the art in  book is done in black and white until  flames enter  pages. those flames can be from bullying, from shame, from attraction, from rage. they all color aiden’s life and refore  pages. it’s highly effective, particularly as aiden makes a decision about suicide.<br /><br />a compelling look at a gay teen learning about himself and finding his core of fire. appropriate for ages 12-15.',\n",
              " \"boy, this book. there's so much great stuff going on. <br /><br />curato's illustrations are simple, minimalist, which makes  use of color really powerful. i loved  artistry that this book conveys alongside  narrative of  story - it's not something that i see as much in graphic novels, mostly because i think  use of art is just a vehicle for  story. but with this book,  art and  story are both doing things on separate levels while also working in tandem. even if you don't like  story,  art itself is beautiful, quiet, and n suddenly powerful and gripping. as an artist, i felt really drawn to it and i celebrate it for that as much as anything else.<br /><br />the story itself - powerful, gut-wrenching. i cried at  end. i was taken on an emotional journey with this book, and though i do not identify as lgbt+ this book really spoke to me and i felt so protective of aiden and wanted to hold him and comfort him in his dark moments. this story is definitely one that many will relate to, wher y are lgbt+, a person of color, heavy, or not, because being bullied, for whatever reason, is an isolating and painful experience that is universally felt. curato does an excellent job of balancing  lows with  highs, and with providing a message of hope. in  end, you are enough, even if everyone else turns ir back on you. i think that, in itself, is enough to make this required reading for any teen out re, eir so y can see mselves in a book or so that y can better understand what some of ir peers might be going through.<br /><br />i would recommend this book to anyone, it's a powerful story and it deserves to be read. i love it very much.\",\n",
              " \"flamer tells  story of  last days of boy scout summer camp for aiden, a slightly chubby filipino american boy, before he starts high school. having been bullied in middle school for his weight, his race and his lack of sports abilities, aiden doesn't want  summer to end. though he faces similar abuses in  boy scouts, he also has a group of friends and he likes being outdoors and away from his perpetually fighting parents. and n re's elias, his tent mate. though elias is a jock, he's kind and he treats aiden like a good friend. this is  summer aiden will have to put up  toughest fight he ever did, not just against  bullies on  outside, but against his own self-doubt and beliefs that clash with who he feels he is. <br /><br />inspired by events from mike curato's life, flamer is a touching, often disturbing look at  pressures of fitting in from many directions. wher it be because of  peer pressure from a bunch of boisterous, macho-acting boys who think homophobic and racist jokes are what makes m tough or because of  greater religious belief systems, aiden feels he is wrong for being who he is. he doesn't understand why he feels  way he does, and he doesn't think anyone will love him if he acts  way he feels. no matter  issue, most people can relate to feeling this way, especially during ir teenage years. aiden's story is unique, yet universal.<br /><br />the pencil drawn art is rar expressive and  color scenes, aiden's dreams and flashbacks, are beautiful. <br /><br />recommended for those who like jean grey/the phoenix, archery, slippery soap, and wet dreams.\",\n",

              " \"mike curator's graphic novel is a devastatingly honest story about  need to belong when you know you don't fit in. it follows aiden navarro over one week at boy scout camp during  summer between middle school and high school. nerdy and chubby, aiden doesn't have many friends at school but at camp it's easier for him to fit in. except that, while many of his fellow campers seem comfortable with tough guy posturing, joking about ir changing bodies, and making gay jokes, aiden is anything but comfortable. not only is he insecure about his body but he's also struggling with  realization that he's gay. aiden's journey of self-discovery comes to a head over  course of  week as  fear that his sexuality could cost him  friends and sense of belonging that camp had previously offered him grows more intense.<br /><br />curato's drawing style in this graphic novel is spare and primitive, as if it was drawn by  teenage aiden himself. that's not to say it's not well drawn, in fact i think curato is remarkable for his ability to express his knowledge of draftsmanship, anatomy, and composition while also mimicking  unpolished style of an adolescent artist and in every panel  artwork keeps  focus on  emotions of aiden and his friends.<br /><br />the writing is strong, spare, and specific, perfectly evoking both aiden's daily life at summer camp and  intense emotions that rise and fall within him over  course of  week. <br /><br />i cannot emphasize enough how much i love this book. it captures so beautifully all  fear and loneliness of being a closeted teenager while never losing sight of  potential for happiness and hope. \",\n",
              " \"this was an amazingly powerful book about  real dilemma that any young people in  lgbtq+ spectrum face and one that hits me personally. i myself was a boy scout and became an eagle scout so scouting was a big part of my life. subjects that were covered in this book were always whispered about but never brought up properly (basically followed don't ask, don't tell in terms of fellow boy scouts.) we were aware of  ban on gay scout masters (they do get into this a little bit) but as far as gay boy scouts mselves, we just never asked. as someone who came out later in his life, i never faced  ridicule mike faced in his youth but i would be lying if i said i couldn't see it happening if i was in his shoes with my troop. mike curato delves deeply into his feelings and passions as an adolescent trying to find his way as not only a boy scout but as someone who went to catholic school. (something i never grew up in.) the raw and unnerving portrayal can be hard to get through but it is something that people need to see because it is real. life is can be raw and unnerving and we can't shy away from it. you can tell he poured himself into this work and for me, it is something to be commended.<br /><br />the art style is on point with his fantasy's, both good and bad, and show a lot of  characters feelings without having to explain. the characters look like teens from  90's and as someone who lived through that time, i related even more to it. nothing is held back and as stated earlier it is hard to get through sometimes but that is not a bad thing in  least.<br /><br />i highly recommend this book for high schoolers and feel it is a must read!\",\n",
